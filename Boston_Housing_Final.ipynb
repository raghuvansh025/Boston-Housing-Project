    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!"

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

    "- `'RM'` is the average number of rooms among homes in the neighborhood.\n",
    "- `'LSTAT'` is the percentage of homeowners in the neighborhood considered \"lower class\" (working poor).\n",
    "- `'PTRATIO'` is the ratio of students to teachers in primary and secondary schools in the neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "** Using your intuition, for each of the three features above, do you think that an increase in the value of that feature would lead to an **increase** in the value of `'MEDV'` or a **decrease** in the value of `'MEDV'`? Justify your answer for each.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** This problem can phrased using examples like below.  \n",
    "* Would you expect a home that has an `'RM'` value(number of rooms) of 6 be worth more or less than a home that has an `'RM'` value of 7?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value(percent of lower class workers) of 15 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'LSTAT'` value of 20?\n",
    "* Would you expect a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value(ratio of students to teachers) of 10 have home prices be worth more or less than a neighborhood that has an `'PTRATIO'` value of 15?"

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "(i) - Increase in 'RM' would lead to increase in value of 'MEDV' because as the house has more space it also gets expensive.\n",
    "(ii)- Increase in LTSAT would lead to decrease of 'MEDV' as the neighbourhood is consists mostly of working poor and people with more net worth would not like to live in between them and this will result to decrease in value of 'MDEV' as they cannot sustain higer prices.\n",
    "(iii) - With the increase in 'PTRATIO' would decrease the value of 'MEDV' as higher 'PTRATIO' is not seen as a good sign for schooling as there are less teachers mainly due to less funds in schools. Hence decreasing the value of 'MEDV'."

    "### Implementation: Define a Performance Metric\n",
    "It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement. For this project, you will be calculating the [*coefficient of determination*](http://stattrek.com/statistics/dictionary.aspx?definition=coefficient_of_determination), R<sup>2</sup>, to quantify your model's performance. The coefficient of determination for a model is a useful statistic in regression analysis, as it often describes how \"good\" that model is at making predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The values for R<sup>2</sup> range from 0 to 1, which captures the percentage of squared correlation between the predicted and actual values of the **target variable**. A model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 0 is no better than a model that always predicts the *mean* of the target variable, whereas a model with an R<sup>2</sup> of 1 perfectly predicts the target variable. Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `performance_metric` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use `r2_score` from `sklearn.metrics` to perform a performance calculation between `y_true` and `y_predict`.\n",

As more training points are added, both training and validation curves seems to run parallel after 300 data points which means providing more training points would not benefit the model with significant improvements but may only increase time consumption for training and testing."

    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

   "cell_type": "markdown",

   "source": [
    "**Answer: **\n",
    "At max_depth of 1, the model suffers from high bias(underfitting) since both the training score and the testing score are low near 0.5 which means the model is not sufficiently capturing the complexity of the problem. At max_depth of 10, the model suffers from high variance. Since the training score is very high but the validation score is lower compared to other max_depth values and the uncertainty in the valiation score is higher which means the data is overfitted."

    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model?

At a max-depth of 3, both validation and training curves are at their smallest/closest level of uncertainty between each other, while the validation score is near its highest value and at max-depth of 4 I can see that curve approaching a score of 1 which means the data is overfitted."

    "A k-fold cross validation training technique takes a dataset and splits it into k bins. The 'k' bins are the discrete set of test data that are obtained from cross validation. During the training stage the algorithm is trained k times using each bin as a testing set once and left out other bins as training set respectively. When testing the model with each bin taken as testing data, we obtaing k different number of test scores. all the score varies from each othe since some data is easy to fit and predict, and other might be hard to predict. mean value all those sets of prediction scores is taken to analyse the model after that. It is useful when applyting the gird search so that the parmaeters are as generalized as possible and if grid search is applied to only one training, testing split the parameters are overfitted for that set.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Fold Cross validation technique is  common type of cross validation that is widely used in machine learning. \n",
    "Here, after splitting our data set, into train and test data, we apply k-fold on the train data set. The training set is split into k equal subsets. Each subset is called a *fold*. \n",
    "For i = 1 to i = k\n",
    "- Keep the fold fi as Validation set and keep all the remaining k-1 folds in the Cross validation training set.\n",
    "- Train your machine learning model using the cross validation training set and calculate the accuracy of your model by validating the predicted results against the validation set.\n",

    "**Benefits of cross validation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To compare the performance of the two machine learning models on the given data set, you can use cross validation.\n",
    "- Cross validation can also be used for selecting suitable parameters. The example mentioned below will illustrate this point well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have to build a K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier for the MNIST data set. To use this classifier, you should provide an appropriate value of the parameter k to the classifier. Choosing the value of k intuitively is not a good idea (beware of overfitting!). You can play around with different values of the parameter k and use cross validation to estimate the performance of the predictive model corresponding to each k. You should finally go ahead with the value of k that gives the best performance of the predictive model on the given data set.\n",

    "For the K Nearest Neighbours (KNN) classifier, you can even choose different metrics. So you can use cross validation to determine which metric is the best for the data set you have.\n"

    "### Implementation: Fitting a Model\n",
    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you will find your implementation is using `ShuffleSplit()` for an alternative form of cross-validation (see the `'cv_sets'` variable). While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that ShuffleSplit has different parameters in scikit-learn versions 0.17 and 0.18.\n",
    "For the `fit_model` function in the code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Use [`DecisionTreeRegressor`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeRegressor.html) from `sklearn.tree` to create a decision tree regressor object.\n",
    "  - Assign this object to the `'regressor'` variable.\n",
    "- Create a dictionary for `'max_depth'` with the values from 1 to 10, and assign this to the `'params'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`make_scorer`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.make_scorer.html) from `sklearn.metrics` to create a scoring function object.\n",
    "  - Pass the `performance_metric` function as a parameter to the object.\n",
    "  - Assign this scoring function to the `'scoring_fnc'` variable.\n",
    "- Use [`GridSearchCV`](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/modules/generated/sklearn.grid_search.GridSearchCV.html) from `sklearn.grid_search` to create a grid search object.\n",
    "  - Pass the variables `'regressor'`, `'params'`, `'scoring_fnc'`, and `'cv_sets'` as parameters to the object. \n",
